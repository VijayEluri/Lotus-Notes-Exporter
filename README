Liberating Lotus Notes databases

It is easy to get data out of Lotus Notes. Easy, that is, once you spend 3 months learning obscure languages (LotusScript) and reading documentation backwards.

And then, when you got your data out, you are looking at multi-megabyte files with obscure XML schema. So, you need a streaming framework to process it document by document.

It is easy. At least for those who use my code. This repository includes LotusNotes Agent to get data out and basic Java framework to then process it.

The code has been used in several production scenarios.

Enjoy.
